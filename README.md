# OpenPAF

> This project is very much in its infancy and not useful for any kind of end-user development purposes at this time.

OpenPAF stands for "Open Procedural Asset Framework" and is a toolchain for creating 3D assets for games, realtime
multimedia, or films. The goal is to have a single set of procedural instructions that can be used to generate both
geometry, textures, and potentially even more complex tasks like automatic rigging and animations.
